# Ideas

Wanted capabilities, captured so they survive. Nothing here is designed, ordered, or committed to — this is a holding pen, like `examples/`. Expect it to be replaced by `.backlog/` once the repository is ready for it.

## Stop personally identifiable information from leaking into git

Projects must not publish the maintainer's real name, personal email, home paths, or machine names. Secrets scanning is the obvious sibling and probably the same machinery with a different list.

Four surfaces, and the non-obvious ones are where the leaks actually happen:

- **Working tree content** — names, emails, `/Users/<name>` paths, hostnames.
- **Commit metadata** — author and committer identity on every commit. This is the surface that leaked in practice while the docs looked clean.
- **History content** — committed once and deleted later is still published.
- **Configuration** — whether `user.email` is set to a noreply address, and whether anything prevents the next bad commit.

Delivery mechanism is undecided. Candidates: install a hook into every project, write the rule into each project's `CLAUDE.md`, run as an inspection only, or some combination. Prevention and detection are both wanted; which one leads is open.

Open design question: the check needs to know which identities are private, but foreman must run with no organization context. That pushes the list into each project being checked — where it is itself published. Hashes rather than literals is one way out.

## Other capabilities named but not yet captured properly

- Bootstrap a new project with the structure it should have had from the first commit.
- Install the standard tooling — linting, tests, continuous integration, independent review, a backlog.
- Meta-skills: skills that generate a project's own best-practice skills, rather than copying a template.
- Return periodically to confirm the latest learnings were actually applied.
