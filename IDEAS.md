# Ideas

Wanted capabilities, captured so they survive. Nothing here is designed, ordered, or committed to — this is a holding pen, like `examples/`. Expect it to be replaced by `.backlog/` once the repository is ready for it.

## Stop personally identifiable information from leaking into git

Projects must not publish the maintainer's real name, personal email, home paths, or machine names. Secrets scanning is the obvious sibling and probably the same machinery with a different list.

Four surfaces, and the non-obvious ones are where the leaks actually happen:

- **Working tree content** — names, emails, `/Users/<name>` paths, hostnames.
- **Commit metadata** — author and committer identity on every commit. This is the surface that leaked in practice while the docs looked clean.
- **History content** — committed once and deleted later is still published.
- **Configuration** — whether `user.email` is set to a noreply address, and whether anything prevents the next bad commit.

Delivery mechanism is undecided. Candidates: install a hook into every project, write the rule into each project's `CLAUDE.md`, run as an inspection only, or some combination. Prevention and detection are both wanted; which one leads is open.

Open design question: the check needs to know which identities are private, but foreman must run with no organization context. That pushes the list into each project being checked — where it is itself published. Hashes rather than literals is one way out.

## Drive an incident, and store it as markdown

When something goes wrong, foreman runs the response rather than leaving it to memory and chat: prompts for what is known, tracks what has been tried, and captures the timeline as it happens rather than reconstructing it afterward. The record is markdown, committed in the affected project.

Likely delivered as a skill foreman installs into a project, rather than something foreman runs itself — the response happens inside the affected repository, with whoever is already working there.

Open: whether incident records conform to the Luma Knowledge Format and live in `.backlog/`, or are their own thing. Also open is whether driving and recording are one capability or two — recording a timeline is useful even when nobody is being walked through the response.

## Other capabilities named but not yet captured properly

- Bootstrap a new project with the structure it should have had from the first commit.
- Install the standard tooling — linting, tests, continuous integration, independent review, a backlog.
- Meta-skills: skills that generate a project's own best-practice skills, rather than copying a template.
- Return periodically to confirm the latest learnings were actually applied.
