# luma/tutorial_step

**One step of a paced tutorial** — a single idea, presented on its own and
followed by a pause. It is the unit a walkthrough advances by, and the reason the
material is many documents rather than one long one: a step is loaded when it is
reached and never before, so the reader pays for what they are looking at rather
than for everything still to come.

A step is not a section. **A section can be skimmed in the presence of its
neighbours; a step is delivered alone, and the reader is expected to stop.**

## How long a step should be

**A rule of thumb for whoever writes one: the whole thing should fit on a laptop
screen without scrolling** — prose and `## Takeaways` together, around three
hundred words and thirty-odd lines. The closing block the procedure adds is a few
lines more, so leave it room.

That is a sizing heuristic and nothing else — **call them steps everywhere a
reader can see, including the heading each one is presented under.** *Screen* describes the constraint an author is writing against;
it is not what the reader is being walked through, and using it in the prose
makes the tutorial sound like it is about the display rather than the material.

The constraint matters because a step is the unit of a stop. **Something too long
to take in at once cannot be paused after** — the reader is still working through
the first half when the offer to answer questions arrives, so they decline it, and
the pause it was meant to allow quietly becomes a formality. If a step
will not fit, it is two steps.

## `pause` is the field the type exists for

**A tutorial that recommends changing something is dangerous in a way an ordinary
document is not**, because the reader is inside a live session while being told
what to do to one. Some of what a walkthrough recommends would destroy the very
session delivering it — clearing it, compacting it, switching its model, or
filling it with the output of a long-running command.

**The reader cannot possibly know which.** The step that says *clear between
jobs* does not say *except right now*, and nothing in prose reliably flags it. So
the step carries the answer, and the agent presenting it does not have to judge:

| | what it means | what to offer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `apply_here` | safe in the session running the tutorial | *go ahead, I'll wait* |
| `apply_elsewhere` | would cost or destroy this session | *open a second window and do it there* |
| `practice` | a statement about how something works, with nothing to change | *try it in another session sometime* |
| `none` | a summary or a close — nothing to act on | nothing; move on |

**Mandatory, with no default.** An omitted `pause` would have to be guessed at,
and the guess that costs somebody their session is the one a default would make.
Requiring it puts the decision with the author, who knows what the step is asking
for, rather than with the agent, which does not.

**`apply_here` is not the safe choice.** It is the specific claim that acting now,
in this session, will work — and on the step that teaches naming the session, it
is the only correct value, because sending the reader elsewhere would name the
wrong session. Neither direction is the conservative one.

## `step` is data, not the filename

Files sort by name, and a walkthrough that gets its order from `01-`, `02-` is
one rename away from a silently reordered tutorial. **Nothing reads the
directory**, so the sequence belongs in the document that occupies the position.

It also survives insertion. Adding a step means renumbering the field on the
steps after it — visible in a diff, and reviewable — rather than renaming files
and hoping every reference moved with them.

## Running a tutorial made of these

**The obligations a driving procedure has to honour**, gathered here so a second
tutorial does not have to reverse-engineer the first. The procedure still states
them — it is what runs — but this is the source they are copied from.

- **Read one step at a time, never ahead.** A walkthrough that loads every step
  up front pays for all of them on every turn, and a tutorial about context cost
  refutes itself by doing it.
- **Present it in full.** A step is already short; summarising it saves the
  reader nothing and discards the wording that was chosen.
- **Stop after every step**, however brief. Never advance unprompted.
- **Offer what `pause` says**, and say plainly how to continue.
- **Say where they are before they leave** — a number and a title, so coming back
  costs one word.
- **Recover rather than restart.** Somebody will lose the session. Ask which step
  they reached and resume there; never replay what they already sat through.

**And know which of your own recommendations would destroy the session running
the tutorial.** That is what `apply_elsewhere` is for, and the driving procedure
should name the specific hazards outright rather than leaving the agent to infer
them mid-run.

## The body has two parts, in this order

**The prose the reader sees, and nothing else.** No presenter notes, no answer
keys, no instructions to the agent — a step is read aloud more or less verbatim,
and anything in it meant for the agent gets read aloud too. Everything aimed at
whoever runs the walkthrough belongs in the driving procedure, or in these fields.

**First, the explanation, written as talking to somebody.** Open with the problem,
the pitfall or the trap. Say why they should care if it is not obvious. Then walk
to the solution conversationally. This part is allowed to take its time — it is
what makes the idea stick rather than merely land.

**Then `## Takeaways`, and it is not optional.** A short list of the operative
points, formatted to be scanned: what to do, what it costs, the number worth
remembering. **The same content as the prose above it, and that is the point** —
a reader who skims takes the list, a reader who wants the argument reads up.

**The failure it prevents is a real one.** Prose that reads beautifully leaves
nothing behind an hour later: the reader agreed with every sentence and cannot
now say what they were supposed to change. Burying the instruction in a paragraph
means it was never given. **If a takeaway cannot be written, the step has not
decided what it is for.**

**The closing block is not part of the body.** How to proceed — practise it here,
practise it elsewhere, say *next* when ready — is rendered by the driving procedure
from `pause`, so its wording stays consistent across every step and cannot be
improvised into sounding like the agent talking to itself.

**By default it is also the only place the pacing is mentioned at all.** Saying a
pause is coming usually buys the reader nothing: they find out when it arrives,
and stopping there reads as natural because it is the obvious thing to do at that
point. Announced up front, it is a procedure somebody was enrolled in.

**The exceptions are real and worth naming**, so this does not harden into a
rule for its own sake. Announce a pause when the reader has to be mentally
prepared for it, or when hitting it unwarned would be jarring — a wait long
enough that silence would read as a failure is the obvious case. **A step that
ends with an offer and a visible way to continue is not one of those.**

## When to reach for this over a plain document

**When it is delivered rather than consulted.** A reference page a reader opens
when they need it is a `document`. A step is pushed at somebody in a fixed order,
one at a time, with a stop after it — and the stop is what needs describing,
which is what `pause` does and no plain document has anywhere to put.
