# Tending ideas

A list of ideas is a garden rather than an archive: it needs visiting, or it
becomes a compost heap that everyone stops opening.[^digital-gardens]

## The growth stages

Recorded in `lifecycle_status`, not a field of their own:

| garden | status | what changed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **seedling** | `draft` | captured. Nobody has thought about it since |
| **budding** | `provisional` | read again, and it survived. Shape emerging |
| **evergreen** | `stable` | worked out. Waiting only on capacity. |
| **pruned** | `archived` | set aside, `archived` dated |

**Most ideas should be seedlings**, and that is healthy. A list where everything
is evergreen means somebody has been polishing instead of deciding.

Stable ideas typically belong in a backlog, immediately - unless they are 
inspirational, grandiose, or marked as someday.

## Tending is a session, not a habit

Gardening does not happen because it is a good idea. It happens because
something makes it happen, and **there is no default cadence yet on purpose** —
the practice needs running by hand a few times before anybody can say honestly
how often it is worth doing.

*Once there is evidence, the cadence becomes a configuration setting per
project or per organization*, because a team capturing three ideas a month and
one capturing thirty do not need the same rhythm.

Until then: run [[tend-ideas]] when the list feels unfamiliar. That is a worse
trigger than a date, and it is honest about what is known.

## Pruning is the point, not the failure

**An idea removed is the practice working.** A list that only grows is one where
nobody has been willing to decide, and it becomes unreadable long before it
becomes large.

Prune when any of these is true:

- **The reason it existed is gone.** The problem was solved another way, or
  stopped mattering.
- **It has been read three times and moved nowhere.** Not enthusiasm, not
  objection — nothing. That is an answer.
- **It was never really an idea.** An observation, a complaint, or a passing
  thought that survived capture.
- **Someone would now say no.** If the answer is obviously *we are not doing
  this*, saying so is more useful than leaving it ambiguous.

## Archive rather than delete — especially somebody else's

**Archiving needs nobody's permission. Deleting needs the person's.**

Set `lifecycle_status: archived` and date `archived`. The idea stops competing
for attention and stays readable, which is the entire point: *we thought about
this and set it aside* is worth more than silence, and it stops the same idea
being captured again in four months.

**Never delete another person's idea without asking.** Pruning is normal;
marking other people's ideas as archived is acceptable, although it's a best
practice to notify them; deleting somebody's contribution without a word is 
not acceptable (assuming they have not left the organization), and the 
social cost of getting it wrong is far higher than the storage.

An agent should **never delete** an idea it did not originate. Archive it and
say so.

## Retention is a setting, not a rule

How long an archived idea is kept **belongs to the organization**. Some will
keep everything forever and be right to. Some will want a year.

*The setting does not exist yet.* When it does, the `archived` date is the clock
it measures from — which is why that field exists.

Deletion always needs confirmation, whatever the retention setting says.

## What tending cannot fix yet

Two gaps, recorded here rather than worked around:

**An idea that graduates has nowhere to go yet.** The destination is settled —
a `stable` idea leans towards the proper backlog, unless it is one of the kinds
that stay ideas: inspirational, grandiose, visionary, or marked `someday`. What
is missing is the backlog itself.

Until there is one, such an idea stays here marked `stable` and somebody
remembers. *That is not good enough and is known not to be.*

**Nothing distinguishes rejected from retired.** An idea deliberately declined
and one that simply expired are both `archived`. That is the same gap the
decision type records, and it should be solved once, for both.
