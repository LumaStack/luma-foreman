# Capture an idea

**The order matters more than any single step.** Writing comes first because
that is what is lost; everything else can be done afterwards and nothing else
can.

Check it is worth capturing at all — [[capturing-ideas]] — then:

## 1. Write it down

One or two sentences. The idea, not the plan.

```yaml
---
type: luma/idea
title: <the idea in one line>
created: { by: <you>, at: <timestamp> }
contributors: [<everyone actively in the exchange>]
---
```

**`contributors` is everyone who was in the exchange** — human and agent alike,
whoever suggested it and whoever wrote it down. Both count.

**Do not stop to research, weigh, or fill in fields.** `horizon` and `scope`
are asked for in step 4, and absent `horizon` already means `someday`.

Put it in `.luma/backlog/ideas/<slug>.md`, or wherever this repository keeps
ideas if luma is not installed — see [[where-an-idea-lives]]. Take the default
(`project`) if the scope is not obvious. It is cheap
to move later and expensive to interrupt the flow now.

## 2. Ask whether there are more ideas

**Ideas arrive in runs.** The one that surfaced is often the one on top, and
stopping to tidy it is how the next three are lost.

*"Anything else while we are here?"* — then repeat step 1 for each. Tidy nothing
until the run is done.

## 3. Now check for duplicates

Once we've confirmed idea flow has reached a pause.
Deliberately after capture, not before. Searching first interrupts the flow and
usually finds nothing.

```sh
ls <ideas-directory>/
grep -ril "<a distinctive word>" <ideas-directory>/
```

**If a version already exists**, the new file is not the keeper. Read both and
decide what the new one adds — a sharper framing, a fresh reason, a case the old
one missed.

- **Propose the merge before making it.** Say what you would add to the existing
  idea and what you would drop.
- **Get agreement**, then append to the existing file and add whoever was
  present to `contributors`.
- **Then delete the duplicate you just wrote.** It is yours and it is minutes
  old, so this is the one deletion that needs nobody's permission.

If the new one is genuinely better, keep it and archive the old — but say so
rather than silently swapping them.

## 4. Ask how much detail is wanted now

Only now, and **ask rather than assume**:

> *Is this a drive-by, or are we curating? Fill these in now, or leave them for
> tending?*

| answer | do |
| --- | --- |
| **drive-by** | nothing more. It is captured, which was the point |
| **in between** | `horizon` and `scope`, ten seconds each |
| **curating** | the problem it addresses, why now, what it would replace |

**A drive-by capture is a complete capture.** Treating a thin idea as a failure
is what makes people stop capturing.

## Working with a human who is actually acknowledging

**Propose; do not file.** Say the idea, ask whether it is worth keeping, take
the refinement, and get agreement before writing anything durable.

An agent that files ideas unilaterally during a session fills the list with
material nobody chose — and the cost lands on whoever tends it later.

Once agreed: **`created.by` is the human**, even if the agent phrased it better,
asked the question that prompted it, and wrote every word of the file.

**Both of you are contributors**, whichever of you said it first. A human who
led you to an idea and a human who had it outright are the same case, and you
transcribing it does not make it less theirs or more yours.

**Name a person only if they saw it and replied.** Not *a session was open* —
auto mode with nobody reading, or a subprocess whose output never surfaced, is
not a human being present, whatever the session claims.

From your side the test is mechanical: **did you put this in front of them and
get a reply?** If not, name nobody. That is what makes proposing before filing
load-bearing rather than polite — it produces the evidence.

## Working alone

An agent may capture its own with only agents in `contributors`, which makes
*nobody has seen this* something a person can search for. Overseeing agents that
review it go in `verified`, which is real and worth recording — and is still not
a human having seen it.

**Flag it when you next speak to one.** When they read it and approve it, that
is a `verified` entry — not authorship and not contribution:

```yaml
verified: [{ by: human:<id>, at: <timestamp> }]
```

*Needs human eyes* is then checkable rather than remembered: `created.by` is an
agent and `verified` holds no human.
